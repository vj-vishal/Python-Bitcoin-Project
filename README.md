# Bitcoin Data Analysis Summary:
In this project, I analyzed historical Bitcoin price data to uncover insights related to price movements, volatility, and trends over different time periods. The analysis was performed using Python, utilizing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. Here’s a breakdown of the key findings:

## 1. Reading Data & Basic Analysis:
The dataset was loaded successfully and preliminary analysis was performed, including checking for missing values, data types, and basic statistics. This initial exploration helped set the foundation for further analysis by understanding the structure and quality of the data.

## 2. Data Preprocessing:
Data preprocessing steps were undertaken to clean the dataset. This included handling missing values, converting data types where necessary, and ensuring the data was in a consistent format for analysis. I also created new features to capture the time series structure of the Bitcoin price data.

## 3. Analyzing Price Changes Over Time:
The change in Bitcoin’s price was tracked over time, focusing on the daily closing prices. Trends, patterns, and volatility were identified by plotting the price movements, highlighting significant price spikes and drops that coincided with global events or market shifts.

## 4. Analyzing Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) Values:
A detailed analysis of Bitcoin's open, high, low, and close values was conducted. This provided insights into the daily price range and volatility. Observing the differences between the daily high and low values revealed key moments of price fluctuation and market sentiment.

## 5. Closing Price Analysis (Normal vs. Log-Scale):
A comparison of Bitcoin's closing price on a normal scale versus logarithmic scale was performed. The log-scale transformation helped to better visualize percentage changes and volatility over time, especially when dealing with large price ranges and exponential growth.

## 6. Closing Price Analysis on Yearly, Quarterly, and Monthly Basis:
The Bitcoin closing price was analyzed on different time frames (yearly, quarterly, and monthly). This time-based aggregation allowed for the identification of long-term trends, seasonal variations, and patterns in Bitcoin’s price behavior over different periods.

## 7. Analyzing Daily Changes in Closing Price:
The daily change in closing price was calculated, highlighting the daily volatility and price fluctuations. By examining the daily percentage changes, I was able to determine how much Bitcoin's price shifts on average each day, providing insights into the market's overall stability and risk.
